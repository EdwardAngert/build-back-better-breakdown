# Build Back Better Act Breakdown

## Goal

A collaborative effort to:

1. Outline each section of the Build Back Better Act in a way that's easier to understand, navigate, and search.

1. Summarize the contents of each section as objectively as possible.

## Remaining Work

- [ ] finish laying out all the original text into sections / subsections
- [ ] intro page
- [ ] algolia search
- [ ] new components
  - [ ] glossary (should this be by section?)
  - [ ] tag each dollar amount, ideally with the purpose
    - [ ] total dollar amounts in a table `| purpose | dollars |`
    - [ ] a glossary-style page that lists out each
- [ ] plain-English translations of each section/page - should probably be a sub page so that the original can stay separate
