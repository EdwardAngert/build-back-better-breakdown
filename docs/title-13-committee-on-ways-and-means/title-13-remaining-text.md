This page has the full text pasted in from https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text in order to make it easier to cut and paste.

Current easiest method:
1. Copy an existing title directory, and paste it in where it belongs
   - If the title is a single page/act/section, as is the case with Title V, no need to create a separate directory for it.
2. Keep the `_category.json` and the first subsection file. Delete all the others, including sub directories.
3. Rename the directory and remaining subsection file, then adjust the information inside `_category.json` to match.
4. Cut then entire Title from this file and paste it into the subsection file you just created.
5. Duplicate the subsection file and rename it as needed. So `title-x-subtitle-a` becomes `title-x-subtitle-b`.
6. In the first subsection file, `title-x-subtitle-a` in our example, keep only the first section (or part if there are multiple). Delete the rest.
7. Continue duplicating each file and removing sections as needed, creating subdirectories if necessary.
   - So
     - first file (A) has everything. duplicate (to B) and rename (B)
     - keep only the first major section in the first file (A)
     - adjust `sidebar_position`, then duplicate the second file (B to C) and rename (C)
     - adjust `sidebar_position`, then keep only the first major section in this file (B)
     - duplicate the third file (C to D)
     - and so on until the last file only has one section left

    Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this subtitle

            PART 1--CORPORATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORMS

                     Subpart A--Corporate Tax Rate

SEC. 138101. INCREASE IN CORPORATE TAX RATE.

    (a) In General.--Section 11(b) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Amount of Tax.--
            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the tax imposed by 
        subsection (a) shall be the sum of--
                    ``(A) 18 percent of so much of the taxable income 
                as does not exceed $400,000,
                    ``(B) 21 percent of so much of the taxable income 
                as exceeds $400,000 but does not exceed $5,000,000, and
                    ``(C) 26.5 percent of so much of the taxable income 
                as exceeds $5,000,000.
        In the case of a corporation which has taxable income in excess 
        of $10,000,000 for any taxable year, the amount of tax 
        determined under the preceding sentence for such taxable year 
        shall be increased by the lesser of (i) 3 percent of such 
        excess, or (ii) $287,000.
            ``(2) Certain personal service corporation not eligible for 
        graduated rates.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the amount of 
        the tax imposed by subsection (a) on the taxable income of a 
        qualified personal service corporation (as defined in section 
        448(d)(2)) shall be equal to 26.5 percent of the taxable 
        income.''.
    (b) Proportional Adjustment of Deduction for Dividends Received.--
            (1) In general.--Section 243(a)(1) is amended by striking 
        ``50 percent'' and inserting ``60 percent''.
            (2) Dividends from 20-percent owned corporations.--Section 
        243(c)(1) is amended--
                    (A) prior to amendment by subparagraph (B), by 
                striking ``65 percent'' and inserting ``72.5 percent'', 
                and
                    (B) by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``60 
                percent''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1561 is amended--
            (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:
    ``(a) In General.--The component members of a controlled group of 
corporations on a December 31 shall, for their taxable years which 
include such December 31, be limited for purposes of this subtitle to--
            ``(1) amounts in each taxable income bracket in the 
        subparagraphs of section 11(b)(1) which do not aggregate more 
        than the maximum amount in each such bracket to which a 
        corporation which is not a component member of a controlled 
        group is entitled, and
            ``(2) one $250,000 ($150,000 if any component member is a 
        corporation described in section 535(c)(2)(B)) amount for 
        purposes of computing the accumulated earnings credit under 
        section 535(c)(2) and (3).
The amounts specified in paragraph (1) shall be divided equally among 
the component members of such group on such December 31 unless all of 
such component members consent (at such time and in such manner as the 
Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) to an apportionment plan 
providing for an unequal allocation of such amounts. The amounts 
specified in paragraph (2) shall be divided equally among the component 
members of such group on such December 31 unless the Secretary 
prescribes regulations permitting an unequal allocation of such 
amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in applying the last sentence 
of section 11(b)(1) to such component members, the taxable income of 
all such component members shall be taken into account and any increase 
in tax under such last sentence shall be divided among such component 
members in the same manner as amounts under paragraph (1).'', and
            (2) by striking ``accumulated earnings credit'' in the 
        heading and inserting ``certain multiple tax benefits''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.
    (e) Normalization Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall 
        not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility 
        property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of 
        service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating 
        results in its regulated books of account, reduces the tax 
        reserve deficit less rapidly or to a lesser extent than such 
        reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption 
        method.
            (2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of 
        the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of 
        enactment of this Act--
                    (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory 
                agency to compute depreciation for public utility 
                property on the basis of an average life or composite 
                rate method, and
                    (B) the taxpayer's books and underlying records did 
                not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply 
                the average rate assumption method,
        the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of 
        accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer 
        uses the alternative method for public utility property that is 
        subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
            (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) Tax reserve deficit.--The term ``tax reserve 
                deficit'' means the excess of--
                            (i) the amount which would be the balance 
                        in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described 
                        in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal 
                        Revenue Code of 1986, or section 
                        167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of such Code as in effect on 
                        the day before the date of the enactment of the 
                        Tax Reform Act of 1986) if the amount of such 
                        reserve were determined by assuming that the 
                        corporate rate increases provided in the 
                        amendments made by this section were in effect 
                        for all prior periods, over
                            (ii) the balance in such reserve as of the 
                        day before such corporate rate increases take 
                        effect.
                    (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average 
                rate assumption method is the method under which the 
                excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced 
                over the remaining lives of the property as used in its 
                regulated books of account which gave rise to the 
                reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if 
                timing differences for the property reverse, the amount 
                of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes 
                is calculated by multiplying--
                            (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred 
                        taxes for the property to the aggregate timing 
                        differences for the property as of the 
                        beginning of the period in question, by
                            (ii) the amount of the timing differences 
                        which reverse during such period.
                    (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' 
                is the method in which the taxpayer--
                            (i) computes the tax reserve deficit on all 
                        public utility property included in the plant 
                        account on the basis of the weighted average 
                        life or composite rate used to compute 
                        depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
                            (ii) reduces the tax reserve deficit 
                        ratably over the remaining regulatory life of 
                        the property.
            (4) Treatment of normalization violation.--If, for any 
        taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of 
        accounting, such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a 
        normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections 
        (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986.
            (5) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or the 
        Secretary's designee, shall issue such regulations or other 
        guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this 
        subsection, including regulations or other guidance to provide 
        appropriate coordination between this subsection, section 
        13001(d) of Public Law 115-97, and section 203(e) of the Tax 
        Reform Act of 1986.

Reporting Groups.--Section 163 is amended by redesignating subsection 
(n) as subsection (p) and by inserting after subsection (m) the 
following new subsection:

        of interest includible in the gross income of such corporation

        such excess.

                        for certain small businesses), and

                recharacterized as one or more transactions directly 
                among any 2 or more of such parties where the Secretary
