This page has the full text pasted in from https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text in order to make it easier to cut and paste.

Current easiest method:
1. Copy an existing title directory, and paste it in where it belongs
   - If the title is a single page/act/section, as is the case with Title V, no need to create a separate directory for it.
2. Keep the `_category.json` and the first subsection file. Delete all the others, including sub directories.
3. Rename the directory and remaining subsection file, then adjust the information inside `_category.json` to match.
4. Cut then entire Title from this file and paste it into the subsection file you just created.
5. Duplicate the subsection file and rename it as needed. So `title-x-subtitle-a` becomes `title-x-subtitle-b`.
6. In the first subsection file, `title-x-subtitle-a` in our example, keep only the first section (or part if there are multiple). Delete the rest.
7. Continue duplicating each file and removing sections as needed, creating subdirectories if necessary.
   - So
     - first file (A) has everything. duplicate (to B) and rename (B)
     - keep only the first major section in the first file (A)
     - adjust `sidebar_position`, then duplicate the second file (B to C) and rename (C)
     - adjust `sidebar_position`, then keep only the first major section in this file (B)
     - duplicate the third file (C to D)
     - and so on until the last file only has one section left

be subject to the negotiation process under section 1194 for the 
voluntary negotiation period with respect to such initial price 
applicability year (and the renegotiation process under such section as 
applicable for any subsequent year during the applicable price

eligible drug that is selected under this subsection for an initial 
price applicability year shall not count toward the required minimum 
amount of drugs to be selected under paragraph (1) for any subsequent 
year, including such a drug so selected that is subject to

subsection (a) with respect to a price applicability period, the 
negotiation-eligible drugs that the Secretary projects will result in 
the greatest savings to the Federal Government or fair price eligible 
individuals during the price applicability period. In making this 
projection of savings for drugs for which there is an AIM price for a 
price applicability period, the savings shall be projected across 
different dosage forms and strengths of the drugs and not based on the 
specific formulation or package size or package type of the drugs, 
taking into consideration both the volume of drugs for which payment is 
made, to the extent such data is available, and the amount by which the 
net price for the drugs exceeds the AIM price for the drugs.

on the list published under subsection (a) with respect to an initial 
price applicability year shall be referred to as a `selected drug' with
