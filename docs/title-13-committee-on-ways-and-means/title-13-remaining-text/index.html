include such December 31, be limited for purposes of this subtitle to--
<code>(1) amounts in each taxable income bracket in the 
        subparagraphs of section 11(b)(1) which do not aggregate more 
        than the maximum amount in each such bracket to which a 
        corporation which is not a component member of a controlled 
        group is entitled, and
            </code>(2) one $250,000 ($150,000 if any component member is a
corporation described in section 535(c)(2)(B)) amount for
purposes of computing the accumulated earnings credit under
section 535(c)(2) and (3).
The amounts specified in paragraph (1) shall be divided equally among
the component members of such group on such December 31 unless all of
such component members consent (at such time and in such manner as the
Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) to an apportionment plan
providing for an unequal allocation of such amounts. The amounts
specified in paragraph (2) shall be divided equally among the component
members of such group on such December 31 unless the Secretary
prescribes regulations permitting an unequal allocation of such
amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in applying the last sentence
of section 11(b)(1) to such component members, the taxable income of
all such component members shall be taken into account and any increase
in tax under such last sentence shall be divided among such component
members in the same manner as amounts under paragraph (1).&#x27;&#x27;, and
(2) by striking <code>accumulated earnings credit&#x27;&#x27; in the 
        heading and inserting </code>certain multiple tax benefits&#x27;&#x27;.
(d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.
(e) Normalization Requirements.--
(1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall
not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility
property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of
service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating
results in its regulated books of account, reduces the tax
reserve deficit less rapidly or to a lesser extent than such
reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption
method.
(2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of
the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of
enactment of this Act--
(A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory
agency to compute depreciation for public utility
property on the basis of an average life or composite
rate method, and
(B) the taxpayer&#x27;s books and underlying records did
not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply
the average rate assumption method,
the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of
accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer
uses the alternative method for public utility property that is
subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
(A) Tax reserve deficit.--The term <code>tax reserve 
                deficit&#x27;&#x27; means the excess of--
                            (i) the amount which would be the balance 
                        in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described 
                        in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal 
                        Revenue Code of 1986, or section 
                        167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of such Code as in effect on 
                        the day before the date of the enactment of the 
                        Tax Reform Act of 1986) if the amount of such 
                        reserve were determined by assuming that the 
                        corporate rate increases provided in the 
                        amendments made by this section were in effect 
                        for all prior periods, over
                            (ii) the balance in such reserve as of the 
                        day before such corporate rate increases take 
                        effect.
                    (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average 
                rate assumption method is the method under which the 
                excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced 
                over the remaining lives of the property as used in its 
                regulated books of account which gave rise to the 
                reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if 
                timing differences for the property reverse, the amount 
                of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes 
                is calculated by multiplying--
                            (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred 
                        taxes for the property to the aggregate timing 
                        differences for the property as of the 
                        beginning of the period in question, by
                            (ii) the amount of the timing differences 
                        which reverse during such period.
                    (C) Alternative method.--The </code>alternative method&#x27;&#x27;
is the method in which the taxpayer--
(i) computes the tax reserve deficit on all
public utility property included in the plant
account on the basis of the weighted average
life or composite rate used to compute
depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
(ii) reduces the tax reserve deficit
ratably over the remaining regulatory life of
the property.
(4) Treatment of normalization violation.--If, for any
taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of
accounting, such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a
normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections
(f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.
(5) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or the
Secretary&#x27;s designee, shall issue such regulations or other
guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this
subsection, including regulations or other guidance to provide
appropriate coordination between this subsection, section
13001(d) of Public Law 115-97, and section 203(e) of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    Subpart B--Limitations on Deduction for Interest Expense</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>SEC. 138111.

                (directly or indirectly) an interest in such entity.
                    ``(C) Branch.--Except as otherwise provided by the

subsection to hybrid entities or hybrid transactions

                subsection:
    </code>(i) Certain Payment Not Treated as Base Erosion Payments.--
<code>(1) Exception for payments on which tax is imposed.--An 
        amount shall not be treated as a base erosion payment if tax is 
        imposed by this subtitle with respect to such amount. The 
        amount not treated as a base erosion payment by reason of the 
        preceding sentence shall be determined under rules similar to 
        the rules of section 163(j)(5) (as in effect before the date of 
        the enactment of Public Law 115-97).
            </code>(2) Exception for certain payments subject to sufficient
foreign tax.--
<code>(A) In general.--An amount shall not be treated 
                as a base erosion payment if the taxpayer establishes 
                to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such amount 
                was subject to an effective rate of foreign income tax 
                (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(F)) which is not less 
                than the applicable percentage in effect under 
                subsection (b)(2) for the taxable year in which such 
                amount is paid or accrued. Except as otherwise provided 
                by the Secretary under subparagraph (B), the effective 
                rate of foreign income tax with respect to any amount 
                may be established on the basis of applicable financial 
                statements (as defined in section 451(b)(3)).
                    </code>(B) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such
regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or
appropriate to carry out the purposes of this
paragraph, including regulations or other guidance
providing procedures for determining the effective rate
of foreign income tax to which any amount is subject.
Such procedures may require that any transaction or
series of transactions among multiple parties be
recharacterized as one or more transactions directly
among any 2 or more of such parties where the Secretary
determines that such recharacterization is appropriate
to carry out, or prevent avoidance of, the purposes of
this section.
<code>(3) Exception for certain amounts with respect to 
        services.--Subsections (d)(1) and (d)(5)(A) shall not apply to 
        so much of any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer for 
        services as does not exceed the total services cost of such 
        services. The preceding sentence shall not apply unless such 
        services meet the requirements for eligibility for use of the 
        services cost method under section 482 (determined without 
        regard to the requirement that the services not contribute 
        significantly to fundamental risks of business success or 
        failure).&#x27;&#x27;.
                    (B) Conforming amendment.--Section 59A(d), as 
                amended by paragraph (2), is amended by striking 
                paragraph (6).
    (c) Repeal of Exemption From Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax for 
Taxpayers With Low Base Erosion Percentage.--Section 59A(e)(1)(C) is 
amended by inserting </code>in the case of any taxable year beginning before
January 1, 2024,&#x27;&#x27; before <code>the base erosion percentage&#x27;&#x27;.
    (d) Other Modifications.--
            (1) Section 59A(h)(2)(B) is amended by striking </code>section
6038B(b)(2)&#x27;&#x27; and inserting <code>section 6038A(b)(2)&#x27;&#x27;.

such individual or foreign corporation, as the case may

treated as 1 plan under subparagraph (A) in
such manner as the taxpayer chooses.
<code>(ii) Allocation to roth iras and

                        which paragraph (2) applies, the portion of any 
                        increase in minimum required distributions by

                            </code>(iii) Special rules for employee stock
ownership plans.--If any payee to which this
subsection applies for any taxable year has
account balances in 1 or more employee stock
ownership plans (as defined in section
4975(e)(7)) any portion of which is invested in
employer securities which are not readily
tradable on an securities market, the increase
in minimum required distributions by reason of
this subsection shall be allocated--

                                clause), and
                                    </code>(II) then to such portions in
such manner as the taxpayer chooses.
The Secretary shall prescribe regulations which
provide that if any such increase is allocated
to any such portion of an account balance for
the first taxable year of the payee beginning
in 2022, the payee may elect to have such
portion distributed over a period of years not
greater than the period specified by the
Secretary in such regulations (and any
distributions made in accordance with such
election shall be treated for purposes of this
section as made in such first taxable year).
<code>(5) Distributions not eligible for rollovers.--For 
        purposes of determining whether a distribution is an eligible 
        rollover distribution, any distribution from an applicable 
        retirement plan which is attributable to any increase in 
        minimum required distributions by reason of this subsection 
        shall be treated as a distribution required under section 
        401(a)(9), 403(b)(10), 408(a)(6), 408(b)(3), or 457(d)(2), 
        whichever is applicable.
            </code>(6) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, any

        under the plan in such amount as the employee may elect,
