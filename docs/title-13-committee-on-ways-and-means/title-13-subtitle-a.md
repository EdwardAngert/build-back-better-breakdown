        requirement of this section, and may disqualify an employer (or 
        administering entity) from receiving (or administering) 
        subsequent grants under this section in the case of repeated 
        violations.

        leave benefits under the employer-sponsored program and such 
        claims have subsequently been approved by the Secretary 
        pursuant to an appeal described in section 2205(a)(1)(B), the 
        Secretary may impose such penalties on the employer (or 
        administering entity) as the Secretary deems appropriate, which

        such employer in any case in which a penalty is imposed under 
        this subsection on the administering entity not later than 30 
        days after the date on which such penalty has been imposed. In

        misconduct exists with respect to an entity administering 
        benefits under this section for multiple employers, the 
        Secretary may disqualify such entity from administering 
        employer-sponsored programs receiving subsequent grants under 
        this section.
