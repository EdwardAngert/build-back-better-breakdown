section for a calendar year to an eligible employer described
in subsection (a)(2) shall be paid by the Secretary not later
than March 31 of the calendar year succeeding such calendar

<code>(3) Penalty for late filing.--In any case in which an 
        eligible employer seeking a grant under this subsection for a 
        calendar year fails to submit all required documentation by the 
        submission deadline for such calendar year as required under 
        subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii)--

benefits were paid, the amount of such paid leave benefit, and, to the
extent available, such other information concerning such individuals as
the Secretary may require for the purpose of carrying out this section
and section 2202(c)(2)(C), and for otherwise carrying out the
provisions of this title, including for the purposes of promoting

under section 2208(b).
<code>(f) Enforcement.--
            </code>(1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct periodic
reviews of employers receiving grants under this section (and
of entities administering such grants). The Secretary may
withdraw approval of the paid family and medical leave benefit
program of an employer in any case in which the Secretary finds
that the employer (or administering entity) has violated any
requirement of this section, and may disqualify an employer (or
administering entity) from receiving (or administering)
subsequent grants under this section in the case of repeated
violations.
<code>(2) Penalties relating to appeals.--In any case in which 
        the Secretary determines that a pattern exists with respect to 
        an employer (or administering entity) in which the employer (or 
        administering entity) has incorrectly denied claims for paid 
        leave benefits under the employer-sponsored program and such 
        claims have subsequently been approved by the Secretary 
        pursuant to an appeal described in section 2205(a)(1)(B), the 
        Secretary may impose such penalties on the employer (or 
        administering entity) as the Secretary deems appropriate, which 
        may include a reduction in, or disqualification from receiving 
        (or administering), subsequent grants under this section.
            </code>(3) Penalties on administering entities.--In the case of
a third-party entity administering a paid family and medical
leave benefit program of an employer, such entity shall notify
such employer in any case in which a penalty is imposed under
this subsection on the administering entity not later than 30
days after the date on which such penalty has been imposed. In
any case in which the Secretary determines that a pattern of
misconduct exists with respect to an entity administering
benefits under this section for multiple employers, the
Secretary may disqualify such entity from administering
employer-sponsored programs receiving subsequent grants under
this section.
<code>(4) Employer and administrator appeals.--An employer (or 
        administering entity) with respect to which a penalty is
