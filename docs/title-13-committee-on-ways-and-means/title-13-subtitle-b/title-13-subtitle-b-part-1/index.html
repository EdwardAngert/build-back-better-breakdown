                        the last day of the first plan year which 
                        begins after the date on which the first 
                        elective contribution described in subparagraph 
                        (A) is made with respect to such employee,

                        an employee for any plan year, a percentage 
                        equal to the minimum percentage described for 
                        such plan year under subparagraph (C).
                            </code>(ii) Payroll deduction contributions.--In
