                recipients in meeting quarterly reporting requirements.
                    ``(B) Authority to extend deadline.--A lead agency 
                may approve a request from such a recipient to extend 
                the reporting deadline for 90 days, but shall accompany 
                such an approval with a notice that failure to submit 
                all information required in the report will result in 
                future ineligibility for such a grant.

        for an employee engaged in child care work for the reported 
        period, the qualified child care provider shall--

                decrease the amount of the child care wage grant (if 
                any) payable to the recipient for the next year; or
                    ``(B) if the recipient is not awarded a child care 
                wage grant for the next year, the recipient shall remit 
                to the lead agency a portion of the grant equal to the

                employees of the provider.
