<code>(b) Qualified Wildfire Mitigation Expenditures.--For purposes of 
this section--
            </code>(1) In general.--The term <code>qualified wildfire mitigation 
        expenditures&#x27; means any specified wildfire mitigation 
        expenditure made pursuant to a qualified State wildfire 
        mitigation program of a State which requires expenditures for 
        wildfire mitigation to be paid both by the taxpayer and such 
        State. Such term shall not include any item of expenditure 
        unless the ratio of the State&#x27;s expenditure for such item to 
        the sum of the State&#x27;s and taxpayer&#x27;s expenditures for such 
        item is not less than 25 percent.
            ``(2) Specified wildfire mitigation expenditure.--The term 
        </code>specified wildfire mitigation expenditure&#x27; means, with respect
to any real property owned or leased by the taxpayer, any
amount paid or incurred to reduce the risk of wildfire by
removing accumulations of vegetation (including establishing,

on such real property.
<code>(3) Qualified state wildfire mitigation program.--The 
        term `qualified State wildfire mitigation program&#x27; means any 
        program of a State the primary purpose of which is to mitigate 
        the risk of wildfires in such State.
            </code>(4) Treatment of reimbursements.--Any amount originally
paid or incurred by the taxpayer which is reimbursed by a State
under a qualified wildfire mitigation program of such State
shall be treated as paid by such State (and not by such
taxpayer).
<code>(c) Application With Other Credits.--
            </code>(1) Business credit treated as part of general business
credit.--So much of the credit which would be allowed under
subsection (a) for any taxable year (determined without regard
to this subsection) that is attributable to expenditures made
in the ordinary course of the taxpayer&#x27;s trade or business (or,
in the case of expenditures made by a State, would have been
expenditures made in the ordinary course of the taxpayer&#x27;s
trade or business if made by the taxpayer) shall be treated as
a credit listed in section 38(b) for taxable year (and not
allowed under subsection (a)).
<code>(2) Personal credit.--For purposes of this title, the 
        credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year 
        (determined after application of paragraph (1)) shall be 
        treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for such taxable 
        year.
    </code>(d) Reduction of Credit Percentage Where Taxpayer Expenditures
Less Than 30 Percent.--
<code>(1) In general.--If the expenditure percentage with 
        respect to any item of qualified wildfire mitigation 
        expenditure is less than 30 percent, subsection (a) shall be 
        applied by substituting `the expenditure percentage&#x27; for `30 
        percent&#x27; with respect to such item of expenditure.
            </code>(2) Expenditure percentage.--For purposes of this
section, the term `expenditure percentage&#x27; means, with respect
to any item of qualified wildfire mitigation expenditure any
portion of which is paid or incurred by a State, the ratio
(expressed as a percentage) of--
<code>(A) the taxpayer&#x27;s expenditure for such item, 
                divided by
                    </code>(B) the sum of the taxpayer&#x27;s and such State&#x27;s
expenditures for such item.
<code>(e) Special Rules.--
            </code>(1) Treatment of expenditures related to marketable
timber.--An expenditure shall not be taken into account for
purposes of this section (whether made by the taxpayer or a
State pursuant to a qualified State wildfire mitigation program
of such State) if such expenditure is properly allocable to
timber which is sold or exchanged by the taxpayer. The
preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that such
amount exceeds the gain on such sale or exchange.
<code>(2) Basis reduction.--For purposes of this subtitle, if 
        the basis of any property would (but for this paragraph) be 
        determined by taking into account any qualified wildfire 
        mitigation expenditure, the basis of such property shall be 
        reduced by the amount of the credit allowed under subsection 
        (a) with respect to such expenditure (determined without regard 
        to subsection (c)).
            </code>(3) Denial of double benefit.--The amount of any
deduction or other credit allowable under this chapter for any
expenditure for which a credit is allowable under subsection
(a) shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowed under such
subsection for such expenditure (determined without regard to
subsection (c)).&#x27;&#x27;.
(b) Conforming Amendments.--
(1) Section 38(b), as amended by the preceding provisions
of this Act, is amended by striking <code>plus&#x27;&#x27; at the end of 
        paragraph (33), by striking the period at the end of paragraph 
        (34) and inserting </code>, plus&#x27;&#x27;, and by adding at the end the
following new paragraph:
<code>(35) the portion of the qualified wildfire mitigation 
        expenditures credit to which section 28(c)(1) applies.&#x27;&#x27;.
            (2) Section 1016(a) is amended by redesignating paragraphs 
        (35) through (38) as paragraphs (36) through (39), 
        respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (34) the 
        following new paragraph:
            </code>(35) to the extent provided in section 28(e)(2),&#x27;&#x27;.
(3) The table of sections for subpart B of part IV of

item relating to section 27 the following new item:</p><p>``Sec. 28. Qualified wildfire mitigation expenditures.&#x27;&#x27;.
