year is, with respect to each qualified residence sold by the taxpayer
during such taxable year in an affordable sale, the lesser of--
<code>(1) the excess (if any) of--
                    </code>(A) the reasonable development costs paid or
incurred by the taxpayer with respect to such qualified
residence, over
<code>(B) the sale price of such qualified residence 
                (reduced by any reasonable expenses paid or incurred by 
                the taxpayer in connection with such sale), or
            </code>(2) 35 percent of the lesser of--
<code>(A) the eligible development costs paid or 
                incurred by the taxpayer with respect to such qualified 
                residence, or
                    </code>(B) 80 percent of the national median sale price
for new homes (as determined pursuant to the most
recent census data available as of the date on which
the neighborhood homes credit agency makes an
allocation for the qualified project).
<code>(b) Development Costs.--For purposes of this section--
            </code>(1) Reasonable development costs.--
<code>(A) In general.--The term `reasonable development 
                costs&#x27; means amounts paid or incurred for the 
                acquisition of buildings and land, construction, 
                substantial rehabilitation, demolition of structures, 
                or environmental remediation, to the extent that the 
                neighborhood homes credit agency determines that such 
                amounts meet the standards specified pursuant to 
                subsection (f)(1)(C) (as of the date on which 
                construction or substantial rehabilitation is 
                substantially complete, as determined by such agency) 
                and are necessary to ensure the financial feasibility 
                of such qualified residence.
                    </code>(B) Considerations in making determination.--In
making the determination under subparagraph (A), the
neighborhood homes credit agency shall consider--
<code>(i) the sources and uses of funds and the 
                        total financing,
                            </code>(ii) any proceeds or receipts generated
or expected to be generated by reason of tax
benefits, and
<code>(iii) the reasonableness of the 
                        developmental costs and fees.
            </code>(2) Eligible development costs.--The term <code>eligible 
        development costs&#x27; means the amount which would be reasonable 
        development costs if the amounts taken into account as paid or 
        incurred for the acquisition of buildings and land did not 
        exceed 75 percent of such costs determined without regard to 
        any amount paid or incurred for the acquisition of buildings 
        and land.
            ``(3) Substantial rehabilitation.--The term </code>substantial
rehabilitation&#x27; means amounts paid or incurred for
rehabilitation of a qualified residence if such amounts exceed
the greater of--
<code>(A) $20,000, or
                    </code>(B) 20 percent of the amounts paid or incurred by
the taxpayer for the acquisition of buildings and land
with respect to such qualified residence.
<code>(4) Construction and rehabilitation only after allocation 
        taken into account.--
                    </code>(A) In general.--The terms <code>reasonable 
                development costs&#x27; and </code>eligible development costs&#x27;
shall not include any amount paid or incurred before
the date on which an allocation is made to the taxpayer
under subsection (e) with respect to the qualified
project of which the qualified residence is part unless
such amount is paid or incurred for the acquisition of
buildings or land.
<code>(B) Land and building acquisition costs.--Amounts 
                paid or incurred for the acquisition of buildings or 
                land shall be included under paragraph (A) only if paid 
                or incurred not more than 3 years before the date on 
                which the allocation referred to in subparagraph (A) is 
                made. If the taxpayer acquired any building or land 
                from an entity (or any related party to such entity) 
                that holds an ownership interest in the taxpayer, then 
                such entity must also have acquired such property 
                within such 3-year period, and the acquisition cost 
                included under subparagraph (A) with respect to the 
                taxpayer shall not exceed the amount such entity paid 
                or incurred to acquire such property.
    </code>(c) Qualified Residence.--For purposes of this section--
<code>(1) In general.--The term `qualified residence&#x27; means a 
        residence that--
                    </code>(A) is real property affixed on a permanent
foundation,
<code>(B) is--
