            </code>(2) the sum of--
<code>(A) $1.25, plus
                    </code>(B) the applicable supplementary amount with

<code>(b) Applicable Supplementary Amount.--For purposes of this 
section, the term `applicable supplementary amount&#x27; means, with respect 
to any sustainable aviation fuel, an amount equal to $0.01 for each 
percentage point by which the lifecycle greehouse gas emissions 
reduction percentage with respect to such fuel exceeds 50 percent. In 
no event shall the applicable supplementary amount determined under 
this subsection exceed $0.50.
    </code>(c) Qualified Mixture.--For purposes of this section, the term
<code>qualified mixture&#x27; means a mixture of sustainable aviation fuel and

petroleum, and
<code>(3) has been certified in accordance with subsection (e) 
        as having a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
        percentage of at least 50 percent.
    </code>(e) Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Percentage.--For
purposes of this section--
<code>(1) In general.--The term `lifecycle greenhouse gas 
        emissions reduction percentage&#x27; means, with respect to any 
        sustainable aviation fuel, the percentage reduction in 
        lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions achieved by such fuel in 
        comparison with petroleum-based jet fuel as stated in a 
        certification which meets the requirements of paragraphs (2).
            </code>(2) Certification methodology.--A certification meets the
requirements of this paragraph if such certification (including
the methodology and process of such certification) conforms

Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States.

        section, the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary 
        of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency, shall establish procedures pursuant to which taxpayers 
        may obtain a certification which meets the requirements of 
        paragraph (2) from the Secretary.
    </code>(f) Registration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Producers.--No
credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any
sustainable aviation fuel unless the producer of such fuel has entered
into an agreement with the Secretary to provide the Secretary such
information with respect to such fuel as the Secretary may require for
purposes of carrying out this section.
<code>(g) Coordination With Credit Against Excise Tax.--The amount of 
the credit determined under this section with respect to any 
sustainable aviation fuel shall, under rules prescribed by the 
Secretary, be properly reduced to take into account any benefit
