subsection applies for any taxable year has
account balances in 1 or more employee stock
ownership plans (as defined in section

employer securities which are not readily
tradable on an securities market, the increase

                                    </code>(II) then to such portions in
such manner as the taxpayer chooses.
The Secretary shall prescribe regulations which
provide that if any such increase is allocated
to any such portion of an account balance for
the first taxable year of the payee beginning
in 2022, the payee may elect to have such
portion distributed over a period of years not
greater than the period specified by the
Secretary in such regulations (and any
distributions made in accordance with such
election shall be treated for purposes of this
section as made in such first taxable year).
<code>(5) Distributions not eligible for rollovers.--For 
        purposes of determining whether a distribution is an eligible 
        rollover distribution, any distribution from an applicable 
        retirement plan which is attributable to any increase in 
        minimum required distributions by reason of this subsection 
        shall be treated as a distribution required under section 
        401(a)(9), 403(b)(10), 408(a)(6), 408(b)(3), or 457(d)(2),
