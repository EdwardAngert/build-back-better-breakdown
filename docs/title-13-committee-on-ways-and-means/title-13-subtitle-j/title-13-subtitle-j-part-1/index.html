                        lowest average price for such drug as compared

for which there is an AIM price available for
such drug, the target price described in this
subparagraph for such drug and respective year

<code>(c) Limitation.--

applicable, renegotiating (including for purposes of determining
whether to renegotiate) the maximum fair price of a selected drug under
this part with the manufacturer of the drug, the Secretary, consistent

<code>(3) Foreign sales information.--To the extent available 
        on a timely basis, including as provided by a manufacturer of
