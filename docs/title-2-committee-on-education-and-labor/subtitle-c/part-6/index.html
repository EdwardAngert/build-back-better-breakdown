(2) shall include any increase in amounts spent by the
State to expand half-day kindergarten programs in the State, as
of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, into full-
day kindergarten programs;
(3) shall not include contributions being used as a non-
Federal share or match for another Federal award;
(4) shall be provided from State or local sources,
contributions from philanthropy or other private organizations,
or a combination of such sources and contributions and
(5) shall count no more than 50 percent of the State&#x27;s
current spending on prekindergarten programs (as of the date of
enactment of this Act) toward the State match.
(g) Maintenance of Effort.--
(1) In general.--If a State reduces its combined fiscal
effort per child for the State&#x27;s preschool program (whether a
publicly funded preschool program or a program under this
section) or through State supplemental assistance funds for
Head Start programs assisted under the Head Start Act (42
U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), or through any State spending on
preschool services for any fiscal year that a State receives
payments under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (c)(2)
(referred to in this paragraph as the ``reduction fiscal
year&#x27;&#x27;) relative to the previous fiscal year, the Secretary, in
collaboration with the Secretary of Education, shall reduce
support for such State under such subsection by the same amount
as the total reduction in State fiscal effort for such
reduction fiscal year.
(2) Waiver.--The Secretary, in collaboration with the
Secretary of Education, may waive the requirements of paragraph
(1) if--
(A) the Secretaries determine that a waiver would
be appropriate due to a precipitous decline in the
financial resources of a State as a result of
unforeseen economic hardship, or a natural disaster,
that has necessitated across-the-board reductions in
State services during the 5-year period preceding the
date of the determination, including for early
childhood education programs; or
(B) due to the circumstance of a State requiring
reductions in specific programs, including early
childhood education, the State presents to the
Secretaries a justification and demonstration why other
programs could not be reduced and how early childhood
education programs in the State will not be
disproportionately harmed by such State reductions.
(h) Supplement Not Supplant.--Funds received under this section
shall be used to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and
local public funds expended on early childhood education programs in
the State.
(i) Nondiscrimination Provisions.--The following provisions of law
shall apply to any program or activity that receives funds provided
under this section:
(1) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C.
1681 et seq.).
(2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.
2000d et seq.).
(3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29
U.S.C. 794).
(4) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
12101 et seq.).
(5) Section 654 of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9849)</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        Subtitle E--Child Nutrition and Related Programs</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>SEC. 24001.
