                                in the family;

                under subsection (c)(2)(A) for a fiscal year shall use 
                amounts provided through the payment to pay the Federal

                free, inclusive, and mixed delivery preschool programs

                described in subsection (c)(3).
                    (B) Amount.--A State shall award a subgrant or 
                contract under this subsection in a sufficient amount

                associated with providing inclusive preschool services 
                for children with disabilities .
                    (C) Duration.--The State shall award a subgrant or 
                contract under this subsection for a period of not less 
                than 3 years, unless the subgrant or contract is 
                terminated or suspended, or the subgrant period is 
                reduced, for cause.
            (2) Enhanced payments for comprehensive services.--In 
        awarding subgrants or contracts under this subsection and in 
        addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (1)(B), the 
        State shall award subgrants or contracts with enhanced payments 
        to eligible providers that offer preschool programs funded 
        under this subsection to a high percentage of low-income 
        children to support--
                    (A) comprehensive services, including social,

            (3) Establishing and expanding universal preschool 
        programs.--
                    (A) Establishing and expanding universal preschool 
                programs in high-need communities.--In awarding 
                subgrants or contracts under this subsection, the State 
                shall first prioritize establishing and expanding 
                universal preschool programs within and across high-
                need communities identified under subsection (c)(6)(B) 
                by awarding subgrants or contracts to eligible 
                providers operating within, or with capacity to operate 
                within and across, such high-need communities. Such 
                subgrants or contracts shall be used to enroll and 
                serve children in the preschool program, including--
                            (i) personnel (including classroom and 
                        administrative personnel), including 
                        compensation and benefits;
                            (ii) costs associated with implementing the 
                        State's preschool standards, providing 
                        curriculum sports, and meeting early learning 
                        and development standards;
                            (iii) professional development, teacher 
                        supports, and training;
                            (iv) implementing developmentally 
                        appropriate health and safety standards 
                        (including licensure, where applicable), 
                        teacher to child ratios, and group size 
                        maximums;
                            (v) materials, equipment and supplies;
                            (vi) meeting health and safety standards, 
                        including licensure; and
                            (vii) rent or mortgage, utilities, building 
                        security, indoor and outdoor maintenance, and 
                        insurance.
            (4) Establishing and expanding universal preschool programs 
        in additional communities.--Once a State that receives a 
        payment under subsection (c)(2)(A) meets the requirements of 
        paragraph (2) with respect to establishing and expanding 
        preschool programs within and across high-need communities, the 
        State shall use any remaining funds from such payment to enroll 
        and serve children in preschool programs, as described in such 
        paragraph, to additional communities in accordance with the 
        statewide needs assessment used for purposes of paragraph 
        (6)(B)(ii). Such funds shall be used for the activities 
        described in (2)(A)(i)-(viii).
    (e) Grants to Localities.--
            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) Eligible locality.--The term ``eligible 
                locality'' means a city, county, or other unit of 
                general local government, a local educational agency, 
                or a Head Start agency.
                    (B) Low-income young child.--The term ``low-income 
                young child'' means a child who is under age 6 and from 
                a family with a family income that is not more than 200 
                percent of the poverty guidelines.
            (2) In general.--The Secretary shall use funds reserved in 
        subsection (b)(2)(F) to award local universal preschool grants 
        to eligible localities located in States that have made it 
        apparent that they will not apply for payments under subsection 
        (c)(2)(A). The Secretary shall award the grants to eligible 
        localities in a State from the allotment made for that State 
        under paragraph (3). The Secretary shall specify the 
        requirements for an eligible locality to conduct a preschool 
        services program under this subsection which shall, to the 
        greatest extent practicable, be consistent with the 
        requirements applicable to States under this section, including 
        ensuring a free, universal, high-quality, inclusive mixed 
        delivery preschool system.
            (3) Allotments.--For each State described in paragraph (2), 
        the Secretary shall allot for the State an amount that bears 
        the same relationship to the funds reserved under subsection 
        (b)(2)(F) as the number of low-income young children in the 
        State bears to the total of all such children in States 
        described in paragraph (2).
            (4) Application.--To receive a grant from the corresponding 
        State allotment under this subsection, an eligible locality 
        shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in 
        such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary 
        may require. The requirements for the application shall, to the 
        greatest extent practicable, be consistent with the State plan 
        requirements applicable to States under this section.
            (5) Priority for localities serving underserved 
        communities.--In awarding a grant under this subsection, the 
        Secretary, in collaboration with the Secretary of Education, 
        shall give priority to eligible localities serving high-need 
        communities, determined in accordance with subsection 
        (d)(2)(B).
    (f) Allowable Sources of Non-Federal Share.--For purposes of 
calculating the amount of the non-Federal share, as determined under 
subsection (c), relating to a payment under such subsection, a State's 
non-Federal share--
            (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including 
        facilities or property, equipment, or services;
            (2) shall include any increase in amounts spent by the 
        State to expand half-day kindergarten programs in the State, as 
        of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, into full-
        day kindergarten programs;
            (3) shall not include contributions being used as a non-
        Federal share or match for another Federal award;
            (4) shall be provided from State or local sources, 
        contributions from philanthropy or other private organizations, 
        or a combination of such sources and contributions and
            (5) shall count no more than 50 percent of the State's 
        current spending on prekindergarten programs (as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act) toward the State match.
    (g) Maintenance of Effort.--
            (1) In general.--If a State reduces its combined fiscal 
        effort per child for the State's preschool program (whether a 
        publicly funded preschool program or a program under this 
        section) or through State supplemental assistance funds for 
        Head Start programs assisted under the Head Start Act (42 
        U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), or through any State spending on 
        preschool services for any fiscal year that a State receives 
        payments under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (c)(2) 
        (referred to in this paragraph as the ``reduction fiscal 
        year'') relative to the previous fiscal year, the Secretary, in 
        collaboration with the Secretary of Education, shall reduce 
        support for such State under such subsection by the same amount 
        as the total reduction in State fiscal effort for such 
        reduction fiscal year.
            (2) Waiver.--The Secretary, in collaboration with the 
        Secretary of Education, may waive the requirements of paragraph 
        (1) if--
                    (A) the Secretaries determine that a waiver would 
                be appropriate due to a precipitous decline in the 
                financial resources of a State as a result of 
                unforeseen economic hardship, or a natural disaster, 
                that has necessitated across-the-board reductions in 
                State services during the 5-year period preceding the 
                date of the determination, including for early 
                childhood education programs; or
                    (B) due to the circumstance of a State requiring 
                reductions in specific programs, including early 
                childhood education, the State presents to the 
                Secretaries a justification and demonstration why other 
                programs could not be reduced and how early childhood 
                education programs in the State will not be 
                disproportionately harmed by such State reductions.
    (h) Supplement Not Supplant.--Funds received under this section 
shall be used to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and 
local public funds expended on early childhood education programs in 
the State.
    (i) Nondiscrimination Provisions.--The following provisions of law 
shall apply to any program or activity that receives funds provided 
under this section:
            (1) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 
        1681 et seq.).
            (2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
        2000d et seq.).
            (3) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
        U.S.C. 794).
            (4) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
