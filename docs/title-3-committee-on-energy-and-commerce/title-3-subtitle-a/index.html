With respect to imposing and collecting the fee under
subsection (a) for an applicable facility in an industry
segment listed in paragraph (3), (5), (6), (7), or (8) of
subsection (b), the Administrator shall impose and collect the
fee on the reported tons of methane emissions that exceed 0.05
percent of the natural gas sent to sale from such facility.
<code>(3) Natural gas transmission.--With respect to imposing 
        and collecting the fee under subsection (a) for an applicable 
        facility in an industry segment listed in paragraph (4) or (9) 
        of subsection (b), the Administrator shall impose and collect 
        the fee on the reported tons of methane emissions that exceed 
        0.11 percent of the natural gas sent to sale from such 
        facility.
    </code>(e) Period.--The fee under subsection (a) shall be imposed and
collected beginning with respect to emissions reported for calendar
year 2023 and for each year thereafter.
<code>(f) Implementation.--In addition to other authorities in this Act 
addressing air pollution from the oil and natural gas sectors, the 
Administrator may issue guidance or regulations as necessary to carry 
out this section.
    </code>(g) Reporting.--Not later than 2 years after the date of
enactment of this section, and as necessary thereafter, the
Administrator shall revise the requirements of subpart W of part 98 of
title 40, Code of Federal Regulations--
<code>(1) to reduce the facility emissions threshold for 
        reporting under such subpart and for paying the fee imposed 
        under this section to 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
        equivalent of greenhouse gases emitted per year; and
            </code>(2) to ensure the reporting under such subpart, and
calculation of fees under subsection (c) of this section, are
based on empirical data and accurately reflect the total
methane emissions from the applicable facilities.
<code>(h) Liability for Fee Payment.--A facility owner or operator&#x27;s 
liability for payment of the fee under subsection (a) is not affected 
in any way by emission standards, permit fees, penalties, or other

        year as a result of the methane fee in subsection (a).
            </code>(2) Use of funds.--The Administrator shall, without
further appropriation, use the amounts transferred under
paragraph (1) (except that no funds shall be disbursed after
September 30, 2028)--
