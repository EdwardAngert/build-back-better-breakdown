(iii) publicly accessible, including a
publicly accessible commercial location, in
accordance with paragraph (1)(C);
(D) the technical specifications of such electric
vehicle supply equipment, including the maximum power
voltage and amperage of such equipment;
(E) an assessment of the electrical capacity at the
location where such electric vehicle supply equipment
is to be installed, and, as necessary, proof of
communication with the electric utility that will serve
the electric vehicle supply equipment to be installed;
and
(F) any other information determined by the
Secretary to be necessary for a complete application.
(3) Funding set-asides.--Each fiscal year, the Secretary

expenses;
(ii) $1,000 for covered expenses associated
with the purchase and installation of non-
networked level 2 charging equipment;
(iii) $4,000 for covered expenses
associated with the purchase and installation
of networked level 2 charging equipment; or
(iv) $100,000 for covered expenses
associated with the purchase and installation
of networked direct current fast charging

expenses;
(ii) $500 for covered expenses associated
with the purchase and installation of non-
networked level 2 charging equipment;
(iii) $2,000 for covered expenses
associated with the purchase and installation

(5) Disbursement of rebate.--
(A) Materials required for disbursement of
rebate.--Before a rebate may be disbursed to an
eligible entity, such eligible entity shall submit to
the Secretary--
(i) a record of payment for covered
expenses expended on the installation of the
electric vehicle supply equipment that is
eligible under paragraph (1);
(ii) a record of payment for the electric
vehicle supply equipment that is eligible under
paragraph (1);
(iii) the global positioning system
location, including the integer number of
degrees, minutes, and seconds, of where such
electric vehicle supply equipment was installed
and identification of whether such location
is--
(I) a multi-unit housing structure;
(II) a workplace; or
(III) publicly accessible,
including a publicly accessible
commercial location, in accordance with
paragraph (1)(C);
(iv) the technical specifications of the

materials submitted under subparagraph (A), as
applicable, for not fewer than 5 years after the date
on which the eligible entity receives the rebate under
the rebate program.
(C) Exception.--The Secretary may decline to
disburse a rebate under the rebate program if materials
submitted under subparagraph (A) vary significantly, as
determined by the Secretary, from the global
positioning system location and technical
specifications for the electric vehicle supply
equipment that is eligible under paragraph (1) provided
in an application under paragraph (2).
(6) Multi-port chargers.--An eligible entity shall be
awarded a rebate under the rebate program for covered expenses
relating to the purchase and installation of a multi-port
charger based on the number of publicly accessible charging
ports, with each subsequent port after the first port being
eligible for 75 percent of the full rebate amount.
(7) Hydrogen fuel cell refueling equipment.--Hydrogen fuel
cell refueling equipment shall be eligible for a rebate under
the rebate program as though it were networked direct current
