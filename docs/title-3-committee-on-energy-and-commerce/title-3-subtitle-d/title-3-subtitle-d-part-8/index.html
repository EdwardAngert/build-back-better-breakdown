appropriate;
(3) the amount of energy and cost savings anticipated to
the Federal Government;
(4) the amount of funding committed to the project by the

        connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, 
        power outlets, electrical equipment, or apparatuses installed 
        specifically for the purpose of delivering energy to an 
        electric vehicle or to a battery intended to be used in an 
        electric vehicle.
            (2) Low carbon material.--The term </code>low carbon material&#x27;&#x27;
means any material for which the quantity of greenhouse gases
(measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent) emitted to
the atmosphere by the manufacture, transportation,
installation, maintenance, and disposal of the material is
significantly lower than such quantity for another, similar
material, as measured and reported in an environmental product
declaration.</p><p>SEC. 30482.

promoting the use of alternative fuels.
(c) Use of Funds.--In carrying out subsection (a), for purposes of
section 544 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42
U.S.C. 17154), the Secretary may also consider to be activities that

(d) Competitive Grants.--In carrying out subsection (a), for
purposes of section 546(c)(2) of the Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17156(c)(2)), the Secretary may give priority to
units of local government that plan to carry out projects to expand the
use of alternative fuels that would result in significant energy
efficiency improvements or reductions in fossil fuel use.
(e) Administrative Expenses.--Of the amount made available under
subsection (a), the Secretary shall reserve 10 percent for
administrative expenses to carry out this section.
(f) Technical Amendments.--Section 543 of the Energy Independence
