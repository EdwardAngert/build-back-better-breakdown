subparagraph) of the amount of such claims.
<code>(3) Amount described.--The amount described in this

respect to a year that is less than the percentage otherwise
specified in section 1354(b)(2)(B) for such year, if the cost
of paying the total eligible attachment range claims for States
described in paragraph (5) for such year at such percentage
otherwise specified would exceed the amount calculated under
paragraph (3) for such year.

paragraph, with respect to years 2023 and 2024, is a State
