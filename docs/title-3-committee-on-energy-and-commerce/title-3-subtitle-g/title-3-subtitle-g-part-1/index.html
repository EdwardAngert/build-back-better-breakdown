        limiting administrative costs, and specifying any other program 
        requirements or standards necessary in contracting with 
        specified entities under this subsection, and overseeing such 
        entities, with respect to the administration of the Federal 
        Medicaid program.
            </code>(6) Preemption.--In carrying out the duties under a
contract entered into under paragraph (1) between the Secretary
and a Medicaid managed care organization or a third party plan
administrator, with respect to a coverage gap State--
<code>(A) the Secretary may establish minimum standards 
                and licensure requirements for such a Medicaid managed 
                care organization or third party plan administrator for 
                purposes of carrying out such duties; and
                    </code>(B) any provisions of law of that State which
relate to the licensing of the organization or
administrator and which prohibit the organization or
administrator from providing coverage pursuant to a
contract under this section shall be superseded.
<code>(7) Penalties.--In the case of an eligible entity with a 
        contract under this section that fails to comply with the 
        requirements of such entity pursuant to this section or such 
        contract, the Secretary may withhold payment (or any portion of 
        such payment) to such entity under this section in accordance 
        with a process specified by the Secretary, impose a corrective 
        action plan on such entity, terminate the contract, or impose a 
        civil monetary penalty on such entity in an amount not to 
        exceed $10,000 for each such failure. In implementing this 
        paragraph, the Secretary shall have the authorities provided 
        the Secretary under section 1932(e) and subparts F and I of 
        part 438 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations.
            </code>(8) Coverage gap geographic area.--For purposes of this
section, the term `coverage gap geographic area&#x27; means an area
of one or more coverage gap States, as specified by the
Secretary, or any area within such a State, as specified by the
Secretary.
<code>(c) Periodic Data Matching.--The Secretary shall, including 
through contract, periodically verify the income of an individual 
enrolled in the Federal Medicaid program for a year, before the end of 
such year, to determine if there has been any change in the 
individual&#x27;s eligibility for benefits under the program. For purposes 
of the previous sentence, in the case that, pursuant to such 
verification, an individual is determined to have had a change in 
income that results in such individual no longer be included as an 
individual described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), the Secretary 
shall apply the same processes and protections as States are required 
under this title to apply with respect to an individual who is 
determined to have had a change in income that results in such 
individual no longer being included as eligible for medical assistance 
under this title (other than pursuant to this section).
    </code>(d) Drug Rebates.--For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(C), in
applying section 1927, the Secretary shall (either directly or through
contracts)--
<code>(1) require an eligible entity with a contract under 
        subsection (b) to report the data required to be reported under 
        section 1927(b)(2) by a State agency and require such entity to 
        submit to the Secretary rebate data, utilization data, and any 
        other information that would otherwise be required under 
        section 1927 to be submitted to the Secretary by a State;
            </code>(2) shall take such actions as are necessary and develop
or adapt such processes and mechanisms as are necessary to
report and collect data as is necessary and to bill and track
rebates under section 1927, as applied pursuant to subsection
(a)(2)(B) for drugs that are provided under the Federal
Medicaid program;
<code>(3) provide that the coverage requirements of 
        prescription drugs under the Federal Medicaid program comply 
        with the coverage requirements under section 1927;
            </code>(4) require that in order for payment to be available
under the Federal Medicaid program or under section 1903(a) for
covered outpatient drugs of a manufacturer, the manufacturer
must have entered into and have in effect a rebate agreement to
provide rebates under section 1927 to the Federal Medicaid
program in the same form and manner as the manufacturer is
required to provide rebates under an agreement described in
section 1927(b) to a State Medicaid program under this title;
<code>(5) require an eligible entity with a contract under 
        subsection (b) to provide for a drug use review program 
        described in subsection (g) of section 1927 in accordance with 
        the requirements applicable to a State under such subsection 
        (g) with respect to a drug use review program; and
            </code>(6) adopt a mechanism to prevent the requirements of
section 1927 from applying to covered outpatient drugs under
the Federal Medicaid program pursuant to this subsection and
subsection (a)(2)(C) if such drugs are subject to discounts
under section 340B of the Public Health Service Act.
<code>(e) Transitions.--
            </code>(1) From exchange plans onto federal medicaid program.--
The Secretary shall provide for a process under which, in the
case of individuals entitled to medical assistance pursuant
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) who are enrolled in qualified
health plans through an Exchange in a coverage gap State, the
Secretary takes such steps as are necessary to transition such
individuals to coverage under the Federal Medicaid program.
Such process shall apply procedures described in section
1943(b)(1)(C) to screen for eligibility and enrollment under
the Federal Medicaid program in the same manner as such
procedures screen for eligibility and enrollment under
qualified health plans through an Exchange established under
title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
<code>(2) In case coverage gap state begins providing coverage 
        under state plan.--The Secretary shall provide for a process 
        for, in the case of a coverage gap State in which the State 
        begins to provide medical assistance to individuals described 
        in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) under the State plan (or 
        waiver of such plan) and the Federal Medicaid program ceases to 
        be offered, transitioning individuals from such program to the 
        State plan (or waiver), as eligible, including a process for 
        transitioning all eligibility redeterminations.
            </code>(3) Authority for phase-in.--The Secretary may apply
section 1902(a)(34), pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(B) of this
section, in accordance with such phased-in implementation as
the Secretary deems necessary, but beginning as soon as
practicable.
<code>(f) Coordination With and Enrollment Through Exchanges.--The 
Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to provide, in the 
case of a coverage gap State in which the Federal Medicaid program is 
offered, for the availability of information on, determinations of 
eligibility for, and enrollment in such program through and coordinated 
with the Exchange established with respect to such State under title I 
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
    </code>(g) Third Party Liability.--The provisions of section 1902(a)(25)
shall apply with respect to the Federal Medicaid program, the
Secretary, and the eligible entities with a contract under subsection
(b) in the same manner as such provisions apply with respect to State
plans under this title (or waiver of such plans) and the State or local
agency administering such plan (or waiver). The Secretary may specify a
timeline (which may include a phase-in) for implementing this
subsection.
<code>(h) Fraud And Abuse Provisions.--Provisions of law (other than 
criminal law provisions) identified by the Secretary, in consultation 
(as appropriate) with the Inspector General of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, that impose sanctions with respect to waste, fraud, 
and abuse under this title or title XI, such as the False Claims Act 
(31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq.), as well as provisions of law (other than 
criminal law provisions) identified by the Secretary that provide 
oversight authority, shall also apply to the Federal Medicaid program.
    </code>(i) Maintenance of Effort.--
<code>(1) Payment.--
                    </code>(A) In general.--In the case of a State that, as
of January 1, 2022, is expending amounts for all
individuals described in section
1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) under the State plan (or waiver
of such plan) and that stops expending amounts for all
such individuals under the State plan (or waiver of
such plan), such State shall for each quarter beginning
after January 1, 2022, during which such State does not
expend amounts for all such individuals provide for
payment under this subsection to the Secretary of the
product of--
<code>(i) 10 percent of, subject to 
                        subparagraph (B), the average monthly per 
                        capita costs expended under the State plan (or 
                        waiver of such plan) for such individuals 
                        during the most recent previous quarter with 
                        respect to which the State expended amounts for 
                        all such individuals; and
                            </code>(ii) the sum, for each month during such
quarter, of the number of individuals enrolled
under such program in such State.
<code>(B) Annual increase.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), in the case of a State with respect 
                to which such subparagraph applies with respect to a 
                period of consecutive quarters occurring during more 
                than one calendar year, for such consecutive quarters 
                occurring during the second of such calendar years or a 
                subsequent calendar year, the average monthly per 
                capita costs for each such quarter for such State 
                determined under subparagraph (A)(i), or this 
                subparagraph, shall be annually increased by the 
                Secretary by the percentage increase in Medicaid 
                spending under this title during the preceding year (as 
                determined based on the most recent National Health 
                Expenditure data with respect to such year).
            </code>(2) Form and manner of payment.--Payment under paragraph
(1) shall be made in a form and manner specified by the
Secretary.
<code>(3) Compliance.--If a State fails to pay to the Secretary 
        an amount required under paragraph (1), interest shall accrue 
        on such amount at the rate provided under section 1903(d)(5). 
        The amount so owed and applicable interest shall be immediately 
        offset against amounts otherwise payable to the State under 
        section 1903(a), in accordance with the Federal Claims 
        Collection Act of 1996 and applicable regulations.
            </code>(4) Data match.--The Secretary shall perform such
periodic data matches as may be necessary to identify and
compute the number of individuals enrolled under the Federal
Medicaid program under section 1948 in a coverage gap State (as
referenced in subsection (a) of such section) for purposes of
computing the amount under paragraph (1).
<code>(5) Notice.--The Secretary shall notify each State 
        described in paragraph (1) not later than a date specified by 
        the Secretary that is before the beginning of each quarter 
        (beginning with 2022) of the amount computed under paragraph 
        (1) for the State for that year.
    </code>(j) Appropriations.--In addition to amounts otherwise available,
there is appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, for each fiscal year such sums as are necessary to carry
out subsections (a) through (i) of this section.&#x27;&#x27;.
(b) Drug Rebate Conforming Amendment.--Section 1927(a)(1) of the
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(a)(1)) is amended in the first
sentence--
(1) by striking <code>or under part B of title XVIII&#x27;&#x27; and
