                        affordable to eligible homebuyers by 
                        discounting the price for which the home will 
                        be sold and to preserve the home&#x27;s 
                        affordability for subsequent homebuyers; and
                            (iii) pre-occupancy home modifications that 
                        may be necessary to meet required property 
                        standards or accommodate qualified homebuyers 
                        or members of their household with 
                        disabilities;
                    (B) use not more than 10 percent of their grant 
                allocation or award for administrative costs and 
                training for carrying out the program of the State or 
                eligible entity to provide assistance with such grant 
                amounts, as well as to develop the capacity to track 
                and monitor program outcomes in consultation with 
                community-based and nonprofit organizations that have 
                as their mission to advance fair housing and fair 
                lending; and

            (2) Amount and layering of assistance.--Assistance under 
        this section--

                qualified homebuyer only once;
                    (B) may not exceed the greater of $20,000 or 10 
                percent of the purchase price in the case of a 
                qualified homebuyer, not to include assistance received 
                under subsection (d)(1)(A)(iii) for disability related 
                home modifications, except that the Secretary may 
                increase such maximum limitation amounts in the case of 
                a qualified homebuyer who is economically 
                disadvantaged; and
                    (C) may be provided to or on behalf of a qualified 
                homebuyer who is receiving assistance from other 
                sources, including other State, Federal, local, 
                private, public, and nonprofit sources, for acquisition

            (3) Prohibition of priority.--In selecting qualified 
        homebuyers for assistance with grant amounts under this 
        section, a State or eligible entity may not provide any 
        priority or preference for homebuyers who are acquiring 
        eligible homes with a mortgage loan made, insured, guaranteed, 
        or otherwise assisted by the State housing finance agency for 
        the State, any other housing agency of the State, or an 
        eligible entity when applicable.
            (4) Repayment of assistance.--
                    (A) Requirement.--The Secretary shall require that, 
                if a homebuyer to or on behalf of whom assistance is 
                provided from grant amounts under this section fails or 
                ceases to occupy the property acquired using such 
                assistance as the primary residence of the homebuyer, 
                except in the case of assistance is provided in 
                connection with the purchase of a principal residence 
                through a shared equity homeownership program, the 
                homebuyer shall repay to the State or eligible entity, 
                as applicable, in a proportional amount of the 
                assistance the homebuyer receives based on the number 
                of years they have occupied the eligible home up to 5 
                years, except that no assistance shall be repaid if the 
                qualified homebuyer occupies the eligible home as a 
                primary residence for 5 years or more.
                    (B) Limitation.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), 
                a homebuyer to or on behalf of whom assistance is 
                provided from grant amounts under this section shall 
                not be liable to the State or eligible entity for the 
                repayment of the amount of such shortage if the 
                homebuyer fails or ceases to occupy the property 
                acquired using such assistance as the principal 
                residence of the homebuyer at least in part because of 
                a hardship, such as death or military deployment; a 
                financial hardship, such as a significant reduction in 
                income, or increase in medical expenses; relocation for 
                a reason related to domestic violence, dating violence, 
                sexual assault, or stalking, as defined in the 
                Secretary&#x27;s regulations implementing the Violence 
                Against Women Act; or relocation for a reason related 
                to the homebuyer or a member of the household&#x27;s 
                disabilities; or another hardships based on criteria 
                established by the Secretary, or sells the property 
                acquired with such assistance before the expiration of 
                the 60-month period beginning on such date of 
                acquisition and the capital gains from such sale to a 
                bona fide purchaser in an arm&#x27;s length transaction are 
                less than the amount the homebuyer is required to repay 
                the State or eligible entity under subparagraph (A).
            (5) Community land trusts and shared equity homeownership 
        programs.--If assistance from grant amounts under this section 
        is provided in connection with an eligible home made available 
        through a community land trust or shared equity homeownership 
        program, such assistance shall remain in the community land 
        trust or shared equity property upon transfer of the property 
        to keep the home affordable to the next eligible community land 
        trust or shared equity homebuyer.
            (6) Reliance on borrower attestations.--No additional 
        documentation beyond the borrower&#x27;s attestation shall be 
        required to demonstrate eligibility under subparagraphs (B) and 
        (C) of subsection (e)(6) and no State, eligible entity, or 
        creditor shall be subject to liability, including monetary 
        penalties or requirements to indemnify a Federal agency or 
        repurchase a loan that has been sold or securitized, based on 
        the provision of assistance under this section to or on behalf 
        of a borrower who does not meet the eligibility requirements 
        under such subparagraphs if the creditor does so in good faith 
        reliance on borrower attestations of eligibility required under 
        such subparagraphs.
            (7) Reporting.--The Secretary may require the reporting of 
        such information on the use of grants provided from the Fund as 
        the Secretary may require to carry out this subsection.
