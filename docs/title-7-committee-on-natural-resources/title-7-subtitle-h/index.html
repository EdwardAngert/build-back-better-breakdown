                has initiated an audit or investigation involving such 
                records and that such records must be maintained for a 
                longer period. In any case when an audit or 
                investigation is underway, records shall be maintained

                production where royalty payments are not received by 
                the Secretary on the date that such payments are due, 
                the Secretary shall charge interest on such 
                underpayments at the same interest rate as the rate 
                applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
                Revenue Code of 1986. In the case of an underpayment, 
                interest shall be computed and charged only on the 
                amount of the deficiency and not on the total amount.
                    (B) Underreporting.--If there is any underreporting 
                of royalty owed on production for any production month

                section, the Secretary shall assess a penalty of not 
                greater than 25 percent of the amount of that 
                underreporting.
                    (C) Self-reporting.--The Secretary may waive or 
                reduce the assessment provided in subparagraph (B) if 
                the person liable for royalty payments under this 
                section corrects the underreporting before the date 
                such person receives notice from the Secretary that an 
                underreporting may have occurred, or before 90 days 
                after the date of the enactment of this section, 
                whichever is later.
                    (D) Waiver.--The Secretary shall waive any portion 
                of an assessment under subparagraph (B) attributable to 
                that portion of the underreporting for which the person 
                responsible for paying the royalty demonstrates that--
                            (i) such person had written authorization 
                        from the Secretary to report royalty on the 
                        value of the production on basis on which it 
                        was reported;
                            (ii) such person had substantial authority 
                        for reporting royalty on the value of the 
                        production on the basis on which it was 
                        reported;
                            (iii) such person previously had notified 
                        the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary 
                        may by rule prescribe, of relevant reasons or 
                        facts affecting the royalty treatment of 
                        specific production which led to the 
                        underreporting; or
                            (iv) such person meets any other exception 
                        which the Secretary may, by rule, establish.

                subsection, the term </code>underreporting&#x27;&#x27; means the
difference between the royalty on the value of the
production that should have been reported and the
