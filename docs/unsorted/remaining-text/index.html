        equal to the loss (if any) to that possession by reason of the 
        amendments made by this section. Such amounts shall be 
        determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on 
        information provided by the government of the respective 
        possession.
            (2) Payments to other possessions.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury shall pay to each possession of the United States 
        which does not have a mirror code tax system amounts estimated 
        by the Secretary of the Treasury as being equal to the 
        aggregate benefits (if any) that would have been provided to 
        residents of such possession by reason of the amendments made 
        by this section if a mirror code tax system had been in effect 
        in such possession. The preceding sentence shall not apply 
        unless the respective possession has a plan, which has been 
        approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, under which such 
        possession will promptly distribute such payments to its 
        residents.

                described in paragraph (2).
            (4) Mirror code tax system.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term </code>mirror code tax system&#x27;&#x27; means, with
respect to any possession of the United States, the income tax
system of such possession if the income tax liability of the
residents of such possession under such system is determined by
reference to the income tax laws of the United States as if
such possession were the United States.
(5) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 1324 of
title 31, United States Code, the payments under this

        expenditure is less than 30 percent, subsection (a) shall be 
        applied by substituting `the expenditure percentage&#x27; for `30 
        percent&#x27; with respect to such item of expenditure.
            </code>(2) Expenditure percentage.--For purposes of this
section, the term `expenditure percentage&#x27; means, with respect
to any item of qualified wildfire mitigation expenditure any
portion of which is paid or incurred by a State, the ratio
(expressed as a percentage) of--
<code>(A) the taxpayer&#x27;s expenditure for such item, 
                divided by
                    </code>(B) the sum of the taxpayer&#x27;s and such State&#x27;s
expenditures for such item.
<code>(e) Special Rules.--
            </code>(1) Treatment of expenditures related to marketable
timber.--An expenditure shall not be taken into account for
purposes of this section (whether made by the taxpayer or a
State pursuant to a qualified State wildfire mitigation program
of such State) if such expenditure is properly allocable to
timber which is sold or exchanged by the taxpayer. The
preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that such
amount exceeds the gain on such sale or exchange.
<code>(2) Basis reduction.--For purposes of this subtitle, if 
        the basis of any property would (but for this paragraph) be 
        determined by taking into account any qualified wildfire 
        mitigation expenditure, the basis of such property shall be 
        reduced by the amount of the credit allowed under subsection 
        (a) with respect to such expenditure (determined without regard 
        to subsection (c)).
            </code>(3) Denial of double benefit.--The amount of any
deduction or other credit allowable under this chapter for any
expenditure for which a credit is allowable under subsection
(a) shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowed under such
subsection for such expenditure (determined without regard to
subsection (c)).&#x27;&#x27;.
(b) Conforming Amendments.--
(1) Section 38(b), as amended by the preceding provisions
of this Act, is amended by striking <code>plus&#x27;&#x27; at the end of

following new paragraph:
<code>(35) the portion of the qualified wildfire mitigation 
        expenditures credit to which section 28(c)(1) applies.&#x27;&#x27;.
            (2) Section 1016(a) is amended by redesignating paragraphs

        elects (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may

        case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (1) who makes the 
        election described in such paragraph, the use on the return for

include such December 31, be limited for purposes of this subtitle to--
<code>(1) amounts in each taxable income bracket in the 
        subparagraphs of section 11(b)(1) which do not aggregate more 
        than the maximum amount in each such bracket to which a 
        corporation which is not a component member of a controlled 
        group is entitled, and
            </code>(2) one $250,000 ($150,000 if any component member is a

Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) to an apportionment plan
providing for an unequal allocation of such amounts. The amounts
specified in paragraph (2) shall be divided equally among the component
members of such group on such December 31 unless the Secretary
prescribes regulations permitting an unequal allocation of such

(2) by striking <code>accumulated earnings credit&#x27;&#x27; in the 
        heading and inserting </code>certain multiple tax benefits&#x27;&#x27;.
(d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.
(e) Normalization Requirements.--
(1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall
not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility
property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of
service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating
results in its regulated books of account, reduces the tax
reserve deficit less rapidly or to a lesser extent than such
reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption
method.
(2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of
the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of
enactment of this Act--
(A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory
agency to compute depreciation for public utility
property on the basis of an average life or composite
rate method, and
(B) the taxpayer&#x27;s books and underlying records did
not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply
the average rate assumption method,
the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of
accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer
uses the alternative method for public utility property that is
subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
(A) Tax reserve deficit.--The term <code>tax reserve 
                deficit&#x27;&#x27; means the excess of--
                            (i) the amount which would be the balance 
                        in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described 
                        in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal 
                        Revenue Code of 1986, or section 
                        167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of such Code as in effect on 
                        the day before the date of the enactment of the 
                        Tax Reform Act of 1986) if the amount of such 
                        reserve were determined by assuming that the 
                        corporate rate increases provided in the 
                        amendments made by this section were in effect 
                        for all prior periods, over
                            (ii) the balance in such reserve as of the 
                        day before such corporate rate increases take 
                        effect.
                    (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average 
                rate assumption method is the method under which the 
                excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced 
                over the remaining lives of the property as used in its 
                regulated books of account which gave rise to the 
                reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if 
                timing differences for the property reverse, the amount 
                of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes 
                is calculated by multiplying--
                            (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred 
                        taxes for the property to the aggregate timing 
                        differences for the property as of the 
                        beginning of the period in question, by
                            (ii) the amount of the timing differences 
                        which reverse during such period.
                    (C) Alternative method.--The </code>alternative method&#x27;&#x27;
is the method in which the taxpayer--
(i) computes the tax reserve deficit on all
public utility property included in the plant
account on the basis of the weighted average
life or composite rate used to compute
depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
(ii) reduces the tax reserve deficit
ratably over the remaining regulatory life of
the property.
(4) Treatment of normalization violation.--If, for any
taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this
Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of
accounting, such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a
normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections
(f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.
(5) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or the
Secretary&#x27;s designee, shall issue such regulations or other
guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this
subsection, including regulations or other guidance to provide
appropriate coordination between this subsection, section
13001(d) of Public Law 115-97, and section 203(e) of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    Subpart B--Limitations on Deduction for Interest Expense</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>SEC. 138111.

            </code>(1) In general.--In the case of any specified domestic

transactions.--In the case of direct costs otherwise
described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) which are
paid or incurred by the foreign person referred to in
such clause to another foreign person which is a
related party of the taxpayer, such costs shall be
taken into account under such clause only to the extent
that the taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Secretary that such costs are attributable to
amounts paid or accrued (directly or indirectly) to a
United States person or a person which is not a related
party of the taxpayer.
<code>(D) Safe harbor with respect indirect costs of 
                foreign related parties.--In the case of a taxpayer

                inventory property, as the Secretary may provide), the 
                amount described in subparagraph (B)(ii) with respect 
                to such property shall be treated for purposes of this

                taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of such 
                property.&#x27;&#x27;.
            (3) Expansion and consolidation of rules to exempt certain 
        payments from treatment as base erosion payments.--
                    (A) In general.--Section 59A is amended by 
                redesignating subsection (i) as subsection (j) and by 
                inserting after subsection (h) the following new 
                subsection:
    </code>(i) Certain Payment Not Treated as Base Erosion Payments.--
<code>(1) Exception for payments on which tax is imposed.--An 
        amount shall not be treated as a base erosion payment if tax is 
        imposed by this subtitle with respect to such amount. The 
        amount not treated as a base erosion payment by reason of the 
        preceding sentence shall be determined under rules similar to 
        the rules of section 163(j)(5) (as in effect before the date of 
        the enactment of Public Law 115-97).
            </code>(2) Exception for certain payments subject to sufficient
foreign tax.--
<code>(A) In general.--An amount shall not be treated 
                as a base erosion payment if the taxpayer establishes 
                to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such amount 
                was subject to an effective rate of foreign income tax 
                (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(F)) which is not less 
                than the applicable percentage in effect under 
                subsection (b)(2) for the taxable year in which such 
                amount is paid or accrued. Except as otherwise provided 
                by the Secretary under subparagraph (B), the effective 
                rate of foreign income tax with respect to any amount 
                may be established on the basis of applicable financial 
                statements (as defined in section 451(b)(3)).
                    </code>(B) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such
regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or
appropriate to carry out the purposes of this
paragraph, including regulations or other guidance
providing procedures for determining the effective rate
of foreign income tax to which any amount is subject.
Such procedures may require that any transaction or
series of transactions among multiple parties be
recharacterized as one or more transactions directly
among any 2 or more of such parties where the Secretary
determines that such recharacterization is appropriate
to carry out, or prevent avoidance of, the purposes of
this section.
<code>(3) Exception for certain amounts with respect to 
        services.--Subsections (d)(1) and (d)(5)(A) shall not apply to 
        so much of any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer for 
        services as does not exceed the total services cost of such 
        services. The preceding sentence shall not apply unless such 
        services meet the requirements for eligibility for use of the 
        services cost method under section 482 (determined without 
        regard to the requirement that the services not contribute 
        significantly to fundamental risks of business success or 
        failure).&#x27;&#x27;.
                    (B) Conforming amendment.--Section 59A(d), as 
                amended by paragraph (2), is amended by striking 
                paragraph (6).
    (c) Repeal of Exemption From Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax for 
Taxpayers With Low Base Erosion Percentage.--Section 59A(e)(1)(C) is 
amended by inserting </code>in the case of any taxable year beginning before
January 1, 2024,&#x27;&#x27; before <code>the base erosion percentage&#x27;&#x27;.
    (d) Other Modifications.--
            (1) Section 59A(h)(2)(B) is amended by striking </code>section
6038B(b)(2)&#x27;&#x27; and inserting <code>section 6038A(b)(2)&#x27;&#x27;.
            (2) Section 59A(j)(2), as redesignated by subsection (b), 
        is amended by striking </code>subsection (g)(3)&#x27;&#x27; and inserting
``subsection (h)(3)&#x27;&#x27;.
(e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            Subpart E--Other Business Tax Provisions</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>SEC. 138141.

greater than the period specified by the
